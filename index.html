      <h2 id="what-this-is">What This Is</h2>
      <p>This is a three-week bootcamp where you'll build and deploy a real web application using AI-assisted development tools. No prior coding experience required.</p>
      <p>By the end, you'll have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A working web app live on the internet</li>
        <li>A GitHub repository you can link on your resume and LinkedIn</li>
        <li>The ability to talk credibly about building software in interviews</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="how-this-is-different">How This Is Different</h2>
      <p>Traditional coding bootcamps teach programming "from the bottom up"—you spend weeks learning syntax before you build anything real. This bootcamp inverts that. You'll have a live website by the end of the first session—a <strong>how-to tutorial</strong> for your app idea that you deploy to GitHub Pages. You'll follow that tutorial as homework, then build the real app in Week 2.</p>
      <p>We start with the question: <em>What do you want to build?</em> Technical concepts get introduced only when they become relevant to your project. This mirrors how many successful founders and product managers actually work.</p>

      <h2 id="who-this-is-for">Who This Is For</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Business school students (especially undergrads) looking to add AI skills to their resume</li>
        <li>No coding experience required—really</li>
        <li>You should have a laptop and be comfortable installing software</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="what-youll-walk-away-with">What You'll Walk Away With</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>A deployed web application</strong> — A real URL you can share with anyone</li>
        <li><strong>A GitHub profile</strong> — The standard way developers showcase their work</li>
        <li><strong>Technical vocabulary</strong> — Enough to hold your own in conversations about software</li>
        <li><strong>A blog post</strong> — (Optional) A write-up of your project for LinkedIn</li>
        <li><strong>Confidence</strong> — Talk about your experience in job interviews</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>In-person meetings will combine live demonstrations along with time to work on projects.</li>
        <li>Things will break. That's normal. We'll fix them together.</li>
        <li>It's casual—no slides, no tests, just everyone working toward a goal.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="what-to-bring-to-each-session">What to bring to each session:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your laptop (Mac, Windows, or Linux)</li>
        <li>Laptop charger</li>
        <li>Your project idea (or pick one from our suggestions)</li>
      </ul>
