      <p>Before the first meeting, you'll need to come up with an idea for the web app you want to build (or choose from one of the options below). A web app is a software application that runs in your web browser and can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. This guide will help you choose an idea that sets you up for success.</p>

      <hr>

      <h2 id="before-the-first-meeting">Before the First Meeting</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Write your app idea</strong> using the template below</li>
        <li><strong>Save it</strong> as <code>my-app-idea.md</code></li>
        <li><strong>Bring it</strong> to the first meeting (on your laptop, ready to open in Cursor)</li>
      </ol>
      <hr>

      <h2 id="what-kind-of-app">What Kind of App Should You Build?</h2>
      <p>The best apps for this bootcamp are what we call <strong>"social CRUD" apps</strong>—apps where multiple users can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>C</strong>reate data (like adding an event, posting a message, or logging an expense)</li>
        <li><strong>R</strong>ead data (viewing what they and others have created)</li>
        <li><strong>U</strong>pdate data (editing their own entries)</li>
        <li><strong>D</strong>elete data (removing things they no longer need)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Think: apps that help groups of people coordinate, share, or track something together.</p>

      <h2 id="describing-your-app-idea">Describing Your App Idea</h2>
      <p>Before the first meeting, write up your app idea in a file called <code>my-app-idea.md</code>. This is an example of a Product Requirements Document (PRD) tailored for this bootcamp. Use the sample template below.</p>

      <h3 id="template">Sample Template</h3>
      <pre><code># App Name

[Give your app a working name—you can always change it later]

## One-Sentence Summary

[Describe your app in one sentence. Who is it for, and what does it help them do?]

## The Problem

[What problem does this app solve? Why would someone want to use it?]

## User Types

[List the types of users. For most apps, this is just "registered users," but some apps might have different roles like "organizers" and "members."]

## Core Features

[List 3-5 things users can DO in your app. Start each with a verb.]

- 
- 
- 
- 

## What Users See

[Describe 2-4 main screens or pages. What information appears on each?]

### Screen 1: [Name]
[Description]

### Screen 2: [Name]
[Description]

### Screen 3: [Name]
[Description]

## Example Scenario

[Walk through a realistic example: A specific person uses your app to accomplish something. Include their name, what they do step-by-step, and what they see.]</code></pre>

      <p>This should be saved as a markdown file. A markdown file is a plain-text file that uses simple formatting—like <code>#</code> for headings and <code>-</code> for lists—that both humans and tools can read easily. You can create and edit it in any text editor.</p>
      <p>The file must be named <code>my-app-idea.md</code> for the next part of this bootcamp.</p>

      <h2 id="example-ideas">Example Ideas</h2>
      <p>Here are three ready-to-use app ideas you can build as-is or adapt to your own needs.</p>

      <h3 id="example-1-studysync">Example 1: StudySync</h3>
      <p>StudySync is a study group coordination app designed for college students who want to find others to study with. Users can post study sessions for specific classes and topics (like "ECON 101 Midterm Review"), and other students can browse and join sessions that match their needs. The app solves a common problem in large lecture classes where it's hard to find study partners—instead of messy group chats, everyone can see what study sessions are happening, who's attending, and sign up with one click. If you've ever wished there was an easier way to organize study groups, this is a great app to build.</p>
      <p>Pre-made template: <a href="preserved/studysync/my-app-idea.md">my-app-idea.md</a></p>

      <h3 id="example-2-potluckpal">Example 2: PotluckPal</h3>
      <p>PotluckPal takes the chaos out of organizing potluck dinners by letting hosts set up dish categories (main dishes, sides, desserts, drinks) and letting guests claim what they'll bring. Instead of ending up with five desserts and no main course, the app shows what's already claimed and what's still needed, guiding guests toward gaps in the menu. Hosts get a shareable invite link and a real-time view of who's bringing what, while guests can easily update their dish if plans change. If you've ever organized (or attended) a potluck that went sideways, you'll immediately see the value in this app.</p>
      <p>Pre-made template: <a href="preserved/potluckpal/my-app-idea.md">my-app-idea.md</a></p>

      <h3 id="example-3-chorechart">Example 3: ChoreChart</h3>
      <p>ChoreChart helps roommates avoid the classic "whose turn is it?" arguments by creating a shared, rotating chore schedule with a history log of who did what and when. Users create a household, invite their roommates, and set up recurring chores that can either rotate automatically or be assigned to specific people. Everyone sees their personal to-do list, can check off completed tasks, and—crucially—can pull up the history to settle any disputes about who's been doing their fair share. If you've ever lived with roommates and dealt with chore drama, this app will feel very relevant.</p>
