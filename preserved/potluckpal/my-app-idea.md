# PotluckPal

## One-Sentence Summary

PotluckPal helps groups organize potluck dinners by letting guests claim dishes to bring, preventing duplicates and ensuring a balanced meal.

## The Problem

When organizing a potluck, hosts often end up with five desserts and no main dishes because there's no coordination. Group texts get confusing, people forget what they signed up for, and someone always has to manually track everything in a spreadsheet.

## User Types

- **Hosts**: Create potluck events and see the full picture of what's being brought
- **Guests**: Join events and claim dishes to bring

(Note: All registered users can be both hosts and guests—the difference is just their role for a specific event)

## Core Features

- Create a potluck event with a name, date, location, and dish categories
- Generate a shareable link to invite guests
- Claim a dish category and specify what you're bringing
- See what dishes are claimed and what's still needed
- Update your dish if plans change

## Example Scenario

Priya is hosting Friendsgiving at her apartment. She creates a potluck in PotluckPal called "Friendsgiving 2024" for November 23rd. She sets up categories: 2 main dishes, 3 sides, 2 desserts, and 2 drinks needed. She copies the invite link and texts it to her friend group.

Her friend Marcus clicks the link, signs up, and sees that one main dish slot is still open. He claims it and types "Roasted Turkey Breast" as his dish. 

Over the next week, friends claim slots: Jasmine brings mac and cheese (side), Omar brings pumpkin pie (dessert), and so on. When someone tries to claim a dessert and both slots are full, they see "Dessert is full—consider bringing a side dish!" and choose to bring green beans instead.

The day before the potluck, Priya checks PotluckPal and sees everything is claimed. She screenshots the list and sends it to the group as a reminder. Everyone shows up with their dish, and nothing is duplicated.
