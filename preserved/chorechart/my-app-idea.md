# ChoreChart

## One-Sentence Summary

ChoreChart helps roommates fairly divide and track household chores, with a simple rotating schedule so everyone does their share.

## The Problem

Roommate chore drama is real. One person feels like they always clean the bathroom, another "forgets" it's their turn to take out trash, and passive-aggressive texts ensue. There's no shared record of who did what, so arguments become "he said, she said."

## Example Scenario

Jordan just moved into an apartment with two roommates, Taylor and Sam. Jordan creates a household in ChoreChart called "Apartment 4B" and invites Taylor and Sam by email.

Once everyone joins, Jordan sets up the chores:
- "Take out trash" - weekly, rotates between all three
- "Clean bathroom" - weekly, rotates between all three
- "Vacuum common areas" - weekly, rotates between all three
- "Wipe kitchen counters" - every 3 days, rotates

The app automatically creates a rotation schedule. This week, Jordan has trash, Taylor has bathroom, and Sam has vacuuming. They each see only their assigned chores on their dashboard.

When Jordan takes out the trash on Tuesday, they open ChoreChart and tap the checkbox. The chore shows as complete, and it's logged in history with a timestamp.

At the end of the month, Sam claims "I always clean the bathroom." Taylor pulls up the history, which shows they've all cleaned it exactly 4 times each. No argument, just data.
