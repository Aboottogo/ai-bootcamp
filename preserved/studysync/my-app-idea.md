# StudySync

## One-Sentence Summary

StudySync helps college students organize and join study sessions for their classes, making it easy to find study partners and coordinate group study time.

## The Problem

It's hard to find people to study with, especially in large lecture classes where you don't know many people. Group chats get messy, and there's no central place to see when and where people are studying. Students often study alone when they'd be more effective studying with others.

## Example Scenario

Maya is taking ECON 101 and has a midterm next week. She opens StudySync and sees there's already a study session posted for "ECON 101 - Midterm Review" on Thursday at 6pm in the library. She clicks "Join" and sees that 4 other students are already attending. 

On Wednesday, she realizes she also wants to study for her statistics class, so she creates a new session: "STATS 200 - Hypothesis Testing Practice" for Friday at 2pm in the campus coffee shop. She adds a note: "Bring practice problems from Chapter 7." 

By Friday morning, 3 other students have joined her session. They meet up, work through problems together, and exchange contact info for future study groups.
