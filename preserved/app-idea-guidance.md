# What Makes a Good App Idea for This Bootcamp

Welcome to the AI-Assisted App Development Bootcamp! Before the first meeting, you'll need to come up with an idea for the app you want to build. This guide will help you choose an idea that sets you up for success.

---

## The Goal

Over approximately two weeks and three in-person meetings, you will use **Cursor** (an AI-powered code editor) to build a working web application from scratch. You don't need to know how to code—Cursor will write the code for you. But you *do* need a clear idea of what you want to build.

By the end of the bootcamp, you'll have:
- A real, working web app that you can share with others
- Your app hosted online (for free) so anyone can use it
- Hands-on experience directing AI tools to build software

## What Kind of App Should You Build?

The best apps for this bootcamp are what we call **"social CRUD" apps**—apps where multiple users can:
- **C**reate data (like adding an event, posting a message, or logging an expense)
- **R**ead data (viewing what they and others have created)
- **U**pdate data (editing their own entries)
- **D**elete data (removing things they no longer need)

Think: apps that help groups of people coordinate, share, or track something together.

### ✅ Good App Ideas

These types of apps work well for this bootcamp:

| Category | Example Ideas |
|----------|---------------|
| **Coordination** | Study group scheduler, club event planner, potluck dish tracker |
| **Tracking** | Shared chore chart for roommates, group fitness challenge tracker |
| **Sharing** | Book club tracker with reviews, recipe collection for a family |
| **Splitting** | Group expense tracker, gift registry coordinator |
| **Collecting** | Team recommendation list, shared reading list |

### ❌ Ideas to Avoid

Some types of apps require technical complexity beyond what we can cover in two weeks. Please avoid:

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Apps that need external data** | Stock prices, weather data, sports scores, etc. require connecting to third-party services that add significant complexity |
| **Apps that integrate with other platforms** | Connecting to Spotify, Google Calendar, social media APIs, etc. involves authentication flows and API management |
| **Real-time collaboration** | Shared whiteboards, collaborative document editing, or multiplayer games require advanced synchronization |
| **Apps with file/image uploads** | Photo galleries, document storage, etc. require additional storage services |
| **Payment processing** | E-commerce, payment splitting with real money, subscriptions involve regulatory and security requirements |
| **Maps and location services** | Location-based features add significant complexity |
| **AI-powered features** | Chatbots, AI assistants, image generation, etc. require additional services and costs |
| **Apps for anonymous users only** | Your app should have user accounts so people can see their own data |

## Describing Your App Idea

Before the first meeting, write up your app idea in a file called `my-app-idea.md`. Use the template below.

### Template

```markdown
# App Name

[Give your app a working name—you can always change it later]

## One-Sentence Summary

[Describe your app in one sentence. Who is it for, and what does it help them do?]

## The Problem

[What problem does this app solve? Why would someone want to use it?]

## User Types

[List the types of users. For most apps, this is just "registered users," but some apps might have different roles like "organizers" and "members."]

## Core Features

[List 3-5 things users can DO in your app. Start each with a verb.]

- 
- 
- 
- 

## What Users See

[Describe 2-4 main screens or pages. What information appears on each?]

### Screen 1: [Name]
[Description]

### Screen 2: [Name]
[Description]

### Screen 3: [Name]
[Description]

## Example Scenario

[Walk through a realistic example: A specific person uses your app to accomplish something. Include their name, what they do step-by-step, and what they see.]
```

## Tips for a Strong App Idea

1. **Start with a real problem.** The best app ideas come from something you or people you know actually deal with. "My roommates and I can never remember whose turn it is to buy toilet paper" is a great starting point.

2. **Keep it focused.** You have two weeks. An app that does one thing well is better than an app that tries to do everything. You can always add features later.

3. **Think in screens.** If you can sketch out 3-4 screens on paper, your idea is probably well-scoped. If you need 10+ screens, consider simplifying.

4. **Multiple users = more interesting.** Apps where users can see or interact with each other's data are more compelling than single-user apps. A shared grocery list is more useful than a private one.

5. **Embrace constraints.** The technical requirements (free hosting, no external APIs, etc.) aren't limitations—they help you focus on a buildable idea.

## Before the First Meeting

1. **Write your app idea** using the template above
2. **Save it** as `my-app-idea.md`
3. **Bring it** to the first meeting (on your laptop, ready to open in Cursor)

At the first meeting, you'll give this idea to Cursor, and it will create a personalized tutorial that guides you through building your specific app.

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether your idea will work, bring it to the first meeting anyway! We can help you adjust it to fit the technical requirements. It's always easier to simplify an ambitious idea than to expand a vague one.

See you at the bootcamp! 🚀
