      <h2 id="create-a-github-account">Create a GitHub Account</h2>
      <p>GitHub is where developers store and share code. It's also your portfolio—recruiters and hiring managers look at GitHub profiles.</p>
      <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a></li>
        <li>Click "Sign up"</li>
        <li>Use your school email (this unlocks student benefits)</li>
        <li>Choose a professional username—this will be visible to employers
          <ul>
            <li>Good: <code>jsmith</code>, <code>jane-smith</code>, <code>jsmith2027</code></li>
            <li>Avoid: <code>xX_codemaster_Xx</code>, <code>partyanimal99</code></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Complete the verification steps</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>You're done when:</strong> You can log in to GitHub and see your dashboard.</p>

      <h2 id="install-cursor">Install Cursor</h2>
      <p>Cursor is a code editor with built-in AI. You describe what you want in plain English, and it writes the code.</p>
      <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://cursor.com/students">cursor.com/students</a></li>
        <li>Click "Download" and choose your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)</li>
        <li>Install the application</li>
        <li><strong>Sign up for the student discount.</strong> Create your Cursor account using your <strong>valid .edu university email</strong>—this is required. Your Cursor account email must match this .edu email, and you must use the same email when you verify your student status.</li>
        <li>Verify your status as a currently enrolled student by clicking "Verify Status" at the top of the <a href="https://cursor.com/students">students page</a> and following the instructions. If you don't already have Cursor Pro, sign up for Cursor Pro in your account settings after verifying.</li>
        <li>Confirm that your account shows "Pro" or "Student" status (the free tier is active)</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Eligible students get one free year of Cursor Pro, including <strong>$20 of usage per month</strong>. That covers normal use of AI features in the editor. If you need additional model capacity beyond the included amount, you can enable usage-based pricing in your account; you'll only be charged for usage above the $20 monthly credit.</p>
      <p><strong>API pricing (in brief):</strong> Cursor Pro gives you a set amount of AI usage each month (the $20 credit). When you use the AI to edit code, ask questions, or generate content, that usage counts against this amount. If you go over it, you can turn on usage-based pricing to keep using more—you pay only for the extra usage. For most students in this bootcamp, the included $20 per month is enough.</p>
      <p><strong>You're done when:</strong> You can open Cursor and see an empty editor window, with your account showing Pro or Student status.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Cursor looks similar to VS Code. If you've used VS Code before, you'll feel at home. If you haven't, don't worry—we'll walk through it together.</p>

      <h2 id="install-git">Install Git</h2>
      <p>Git is the tool that tracks changes to your code and lets you upload it to GitHub. Think of it like "track changes" in Word, but for code.</p>

      <h3 id="mac">Mac</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Open Terminal (search for "Terminal" in Spotlight, or find it in Applications → Utilities)</li>
        <li>Type <code>git --version</code> and press Enter. If you see a version number (e.g. <code>git version 2.x.x</code>), Git is already installed—you're done.</li>
        <li>If Git is not installed, install it by running the Xcode Command Line Tools installer. In Terminal, type <code>xcode-select --install</code> and press Enter.</li>
        <li>A dialog will appear asking to install the command line developer tools. Click "Install" and wait for the installation to finish.</li>
        <li>When it's done, run <code>git --version</code> again to verify. You should see a version number.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
      <p><strong>Option A: Install Git directly</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://git-scm.com">git-scm.com</a></li>
        <li>Download the Windows installer</li>
        <li>Run the installer, accepting the default options</li>
        <li>Open Command Prompt and type <code>git --version</code> to verify</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Option B: Install GitHub Desktop (easier)</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://desktop.github.com">desktop.github.com</a></li>
        <li>Download and install GitHub Desktop</li>
        <li>Sign in with your GitHub account</li>
        <li>GitHub Desktop includes Git automatically</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="configure-git">Configure Git</h3>
      <p>After installing, open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run these two commands, replacing with your actual name and email:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@school.edu"</code></pre>
      <p>This tells Git who you are, so your commits are attributed to you.</p>
      <p><strong>You're done when:</strong> Running <code>git --version</code> shows a version number (or GitHub Desktop is installed and signed in).</p>

      <hr>

      <h2 id="configure-github-in-cursor">Configure GitHub in Cursor</h2>
      <p>Connect your GitHub account to Cursor so you can push and pull code without entering credentials every time. Use the same GitHub account you created in the steps above.</p>
      <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open Cursor</li>
        <li>Open the Source Control view by clicking the branch icon in the left sidebar, or go to <strong>View → Source Control</strong></li>
        <li>If you're not signed in to GitHub, click <strong>Sign in with GitHub</strong> (or click the account icon in the bottom-left corner and choose <strong>Turn on Settings Sync</strong> or <strong>Sign in to GitHub</strong>)</li>
        <li>Complete the sign-in in your browser when prompted. Authorize Cursor to access your GitHub account</li>
        <li>Once signed in, Cursor will use your GitHub account for cloning repos, pushing, and pulling—no need to enter your password each time</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>You're done when:</strong> Your GitHub account appears in the Source Control view or in the account menu (bottom-left), and you're ready to clone and push repos from Cursor.</p>

      <h2 id="choose-your-project-idea">Choose Your Project Idea</h2>
      <p>You need to arrive at Meeting 1 with a project in mind. This can be:</p>
      <p><strong>Option A: Your own idea</strong></p>
      <p>Think about a simple tool that would be useful to you or people you know. Good projects have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A clear purpose (what problem does it solve?)</li>
        <li>A small number of features (you can always add more later)</li>
        <li>Users who can create accounts and save data</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Option B: Pick from our suggestions</strong></p>
      <p>See the <a href="app-idea.html">Project Ideas</a> page for guidance and ready-to-use ideas with descriptions and feature lists.</p>
      <p><strong>Create a text file with your app idea.</strong> Save it as <code>my-app-idea.txt</code> (or similar). Include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What does your app do?</li>
        <li>Who would use it?</li>
        <li>What are 2-3 core features?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will <strong>attach this file</strong> in Meeting 1 when you prompt Cursor to generate your tutorial. Keep it somewhere easy to find (e.g. in a folder you'll open in Cursor).</p>
      <p><strong>Example</strong> (for a personal expense tracker):</p>
      <pre><code>Personal expense tracker. Users: me and other students who want to see where their money goes. Core features: log expenses with date, amount, and category; view a list of all expenses; see monthly totals.</code></pre>
      <p><strong>You're done when:</strong> You have the text file saved and can attach it in Cursor during Meeting 1.</p>

      <h2 id="verify-your-setup">Verify Your Setup</h2>
      <p>Before Meeting 1, make sure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can log in to GitHub</li>
        <li>Cursor opens and shows your account as "Pro" or "Student"</li>
        <li>Your GitHub account is signed in within Cursor (Source Control or account menu)</li>
        <li>Running <code>git --version</code> in Terminal/Command Prompt shows a version number</li>
        <li>You have your app-idea text file ready (<code>my-app-idea.txt</code> or similar)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If any of these aren't working, note what's wrong and we'll troubleshoot at the start of Meeting 1.</p>
