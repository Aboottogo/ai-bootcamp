# AI-Assisted App Development Bootcamp

## What This Is

This is a three-week bootcamp where you'll build and deploy a real web application using AI-assisted development tools. No prior coding experience required.

By the end, you'll have:
- A working web app live on the internet
- A GitHub repository you can link on your resume and LinkedIn
- The ability to talk credibly about building software in interviews

## How This Is Different

Traditional coding bootcamps teach programming "from the bottom up"—you spend weeks learning syntax before you build anything real. This bootcamp inverts that. You'll have a live website by the end of the first session—a **how-to tutorial** for your app idea that you deploy to GitHub Pages. You'll follow that tutorial as homework, then build the real app in Week 2.

We start with the question: *What do you want to build?* Technical concepts get introduced only when they become relevant to your project. This mirrors how many successful founders and product managers actually work.

## What You'll Use

All tools are free for students:

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Cursor** | AI-powered code editor—describe what you want, it writes the code |
| **GitHub** | Hosts your code and serves as your portfolio |
| **Vercel** | Hosts your app on the web, auto-updates when you push code |
| **Supabase** | Database and user authentication |

## The Schedule

| Week | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Before Week 1** | Complete pre-work: install tools, create accounts, choose your project idea |
| **Week 1** | Generate a how-to tutorial for your app idea, deploy it to GitHub Pages |
| **Week 2** | Build your full app with a database, deploy to Vercel |
| **Week 3** | Polish, document, and present your project |

Each session is 2 hours. Come with your laptop.

## Who This Is For

- Undergraduate business students (especially freshmen and sophomores)
- No coding experience required—really
- You should have a laptop and be comfortable installing software

## What You'll Walk Away With

1. **A deployed web application** — A real URL you can share with anyone
2. **A GitHub profile** — The standard way developers showcase their work
3. **Technical vocabulary** — Enough to hold your own in conversations about software
4. **A blog post** — (Optional) A write-up of your project for LinkedIn
5. **Confidence** — The knowledge that you can build things

## Before You Begin

**What to bring to each session:**
- Your laptop (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Laptop charger
- Your project idea (or pick one from our suggestions)

**Expectations:**
- Complete the pre-work before Meeting 1
- Bring questions—there are no dumb ones
- Help your neighbors when you figure something out
- Things will break. That's normal. We'll fix them together.

**Format:**
Each session starts with a brief introduction (10-15 minutes), then you'll spend most of the time building with support from instructors and TAs. It's casual—no lectures, no slides, just building.
