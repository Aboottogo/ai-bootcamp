# What is Cursor?

Cursor is a code editor—a program where you write and edit code. But unlike traditional editors, Cursor has AI built in. You can describe what you want in plain English, and Cursor will write the code for you.

This doesn't mean you don't need to understand anything. You still need to:
- Know what you're trying to build
- Review what Cursor generates
- Guide it when it gets things wrong
- Understand enough to debug problems

Think of Cursor as a very fast assistant who's good at writing code but needs clear direction.

**Key things to know:**
- `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows) opens the AI prompt—this is how you tell Cursor what to build
- Cursor generates files and code based on your description
- You can always ask Cursor to modify, fix, or explain what it created
- For multi-step tasks (like generating a whole tutorial site), we'll use **Plan mode** in the Agent (Composer): Cursor plans first, then builds

*Reminder (styled as a box on the site):* You *will* get stuck sometimes—everyone does. When that happens, use the **Ask** feature in Cursor: describe what you're trying to do and what went wrong, and work through the problem with the AI. There's no need to struggle alone.
