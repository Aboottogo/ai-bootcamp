# Meeting 3: Polish & Present

**Goal:** Finish strong. Present your work. Leave with portfolio-ready assets.

This is the final session. You'll put the finishing touches on your project, share what you built with your cohort, and set yourself up for what comes next—whether that's adding this to your LinkedIn, continuing to build, or helping improve this curriculum.

# In-Class

## Writing a Good README

Every GitHub repository should have a README file. It's the first thing people see when they visit your repo—including recruiters, hiring managers, or anyone you share the link with.

A good README answers three questions:

### 1. What is this?

Start with a clear, one-sentence description:

> "SpendWise is a personal expense tracking app that helps users log expenses by category and visualize monthly spending."

### 2. What can it do?

List the main features:

> **Features:**
> - User authentication (signup, login, logout)
> - Add expenses with amount, category, date, and description
> - View all expenses in a sortable list
> - See monthly spending totals
> - Filter expenses by category

### 3. How do I run it?

For anyone who wants to try your code locally:

> **Getting Started:**
> 1. Clone the repository
> 2. Run `npm install`
> 3. Create a `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials
> 4. Run `npm run dev`
> 5. Open `http://localhost:3000`

### A simple template

```markdown
# Project Name

One-sentence description of what this project does.

## Features

- Feature one
- Feature two
- Feature three

## Built With

- Next.js
- Supabase
- Vercel
- Cursor AI

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Add environment variables (see `.env.example`)
4. Run `npm run dev`

## Live Demo

[Link to your deployed app]

## Author

Your Name - [Your LinkedIn](link)
```

### How to add/update your README

1. In Cursor, create or open `README.md` in your project root
2. Write your content using the template above
3. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add README"
   git push
   ```

Your GitHub repository will now display your README prominently on the main page.

## Preparing Your Presentation

You'll have 2-3 minutes to share your project with the group. This isn't a formal presentation—no slides needed. Just share your screen and talk.

### Structure

Cover three things:

**1. What you built (30-60 seconds)**
- Show your live app (the Vercel URL)
- Click through the main features
- Explain who it's for and what problem it solves

**2. What was hard (30-60 seconds)**
- Pick one challenge you faced
- What went wrong? What was confusing?
- How did you figure it out?

**3. What you learned (30-60 seconds)**
- What do you know now that you didn't know three weeks ago?
- What surprised you about the process?
- Would you build something again?

### Tips

- **Practice once** before presenting. Time yourself. Two minutes goes fast.
- **It's okay if your app isn't perfect.** Bugs happen. Unfinished features are fine. Talk about what you learned, not just what you shipped.
- **Speak to the room**, not your screen. Glance at the audience.
- **Don't apologize** for things that didn't work. Just describe them matter-of-factly and explain what you'd do differently.

## Work Time

Use this time to:

### Finish your README
If you haven't written one yet, do it now. Use the template above.

### Final bug fixes
Is there anything broken that's been bugging you? Last chance to ask Cursor to fix it.

### Test your live app
Open your Vercel URL. Does everything work? Create a test account, try the main flows.

### Prepare your presentation
- Open your Vercel URL in a browser tab
- Decide what you'll demo
- Think about what you'll say for "what was hard" and "what I learned"

### Update your LinkedIn (optional but recommended)
Add your project to LinkedIn:
1. Go to your LinkedIn profile
2. Scroll to "Projects" section (or add it)
3. Click "+" to add a new project
4. Include: project name, description, your Vercel URL, your GitHub URL

---

## Presentations

Each person presents for 2-3 minutes:

1. **What you built** — show the live app, explain what it does
2. **What was hard** — share a challenge you faced
3. **What you learned** — reflect on the experience

No Q&A during presentations (to keep us on time), but feel free to chat with people afterward about their projects.

## How to Keep Learning

You've learned enough to be dangerous. Here's how to keep going.

### Keep building

The best way to learn is to build. Ideas for next projects:
- Expand the app you just built—add features you didn't have time for
- Build something for a club, a friend, or a personal need
- Try a mobile app using the same tools (React Native works well with Supabase)

### Resources for continued learning

**Cursor:**
- Just keep using it. You learn prompting by doing.

**JavaScript/React:**
- [The official React tutorial](https://react.dev/learn)
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info) for fundamentals

**Supabase:**
- [Supabase documentation](https://supabase.com/docs)
- [Supabase YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Supabase)

**Git:**
- [GitHub Skills](https://skills.github.com) — free interactive courses

**General web development:**
- [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)
- [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)

### Get help when stuck

- **Ask Cursor** — paste error messages, describe what's wrong
- **Search the error** — someone else has probably hit the same issue
- **Stack Overflow** — the classic developer Q&A site
- **AI assistants** — Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini can all help debug

## You Did It

Three weeks ago, you had never deployed an app. Now you have:

- A live web application anyone can use
- A GitHub repository showcasing your code
- A blog post explaining what you built
- Skills that will make you more effective in any role that touches technology

This isn't the end. It's a starting point. Keep building.
