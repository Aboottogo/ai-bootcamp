# What is Git?

Git is a version control system. That's a fancy way of saying it tracks every change you make to your code.

Why this matters:
- **Undo mistakes:** If you break something, you can go back to a working version
- **Track history:** See what changed and when
- **Collaboration:** Multiple people can work on the same project
- **Portfolio:** Your Git history shows employers you can ship code

**Key vocabulary:**
- **Repository (repo):** A project folder tracked by Git
- **Commit:** A saved snapshot of your code at a point in time (like a save point in a video game)
- **Push:** Upload your commits to GitHub
- **Pull:** Download changes from GitHub to your computer

Today you'll do all four: create a repo, make commits, and push to GitHub.
