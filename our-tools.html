      <h1 id="our-tools">4. Our Tools</h1>
      <p>This page introduces the key tools in this course through a series of exercises.</p>

      <h2 id="what-is-cursor">4.1 What is Cursor?</h2>
      <p>Cursor is a code editor—a program where you write and edit code. But unlike traditional editors, Cursor has AI built in. You can describe what you want in plain English, and Cursor will write the code for you.</p>
      <p>Cursor uses <strong>agentic</strong> AI. That means it can take actions directly—creating files, editing code, and navigating between files—rather than just answering questions or generating text. If you've used tools like ChatGPT, you're used to AI that responds to prompts but doesn't change anything directly. Agentic AI goes further: it can read your project, make edits, and iterate until the task is done.</p>
      <p>Cursor always works within a folder on your computer (often called a <strong>project folder</strong>). That folder is your workspace: every file you create or edit lives inside it. Cursor needs this scope so it knows where to look for files, where to create new ones, and what belongs together. If you haven't opened a folder yet, Cursor won't know where to save anything.</p>
      <p><strong>To open a new project folder in Cursor:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a new folder on your computer (e.g. on your Desktop or in Documents) and name it <code>test-project</code></li>
        <li>In Cursor, go to <strong>File → Open Folder</strong> (or <code>Cmd+O</code> on Mac, <code>Ctrl+K Ctrl+O</code> on Windows)</li>
        <li>Select the <code>test-project</code> folder and click <strong>Open</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <div class="exercise-box">
        <h3 id="exercise-1-write-a-poem">4.1.1 Exercise 1: Write a Poem to poem.txt ✅</h3>
        <p>With your <code>test-project</code> folder open in Cursor, use the AI to create a file:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Press <code>Cmd+I</code> (Mac) or <code>Ctrl+I</code> (Windows) to open the AI prompt.
            <p class="step-tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> You can change the layout by clicking the gear icon in the upper right corner and selecting the option to view just the chat window to clear up some clutter.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Ask Cursor to write a poem and save it to <code>poem.txt</code> (e.g. "Write a short poem and save it to poem.txt")</li>
          <li>See what happens!</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>What you learned:</strong> You can ask Cursor to create files from a simple prompt—just describe what you want and where to save it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <p>When Cursor makes changes to your code, you'll have a chance to review them before they're finalized. You can <strong>Undo All</strong> to reject the changes, or <strong>Accept All</strong> to keep them.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="exercise-box">
        <h3 id="exercise-2-create-a-website-for-the-poem">4.1.2 Exercise 2: Create a Webpage for the Poem ✅</h3>
        <p>Now turn your poem into a webpage:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Press <code>Cmd+I</code> (Mac) or <code>Ctrl+I</code> (Windows) to open the AI prompt.
            <p class="step-tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> You can start a new chat for each different task—click the plus (+) icon at the top of the Composer panel, or press <code>Cmd+N</code> (Mac) / <code>Ctrl+N</code> (Windows). Starting fresh keeps each conversation focused.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Ask Cursor to create an HTML file that displays the poem with some nice styling (e.g. "Create an HTML file that displays my poem with some nice styling")</li>
          <li>Open the HTML file to view it in your browser: go to your <code>test-project</code> folder on your computer (e.g. on your Desktop or in Documents) and double-click the HTML file</li>
          <li>Ask Cursor to make a change—e.g. "Use a different font" or "Make the background darker"</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>What you learned:</strong> Cursor can turn your content into a styled webpage—and you can refine it over multiple iterations. Describe what you want, review the result, ask for changes, and repeat until it looks right.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <p>Cursor offers different modes so you can choose how the AI helps:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Plan</strong> is for thinking before typing—it helps outline architecture, steps, and trade-offs without touching code. Use it when you're starting something non-trivial or want to sanity-check an approach before committing.</li>
          <li><strong>Agent</strong> actively writes, edits, and navigates code across files to accomplish a task end-to-end. Use it when you want Cursor to "just do the work," like implementing a feature or refactoring with minimal back-and-forth.</li>
          <li><strong>Ask</strong> answers questions about your codebase, errors, or concepts without making changes. Use it when you want explanations, guidance, or quick understanding rather than modifications.</li>
          <li><strong>Debug</strong> focuses on diagnosing bugs by reasoning through failures, stack traces, and runtime behavior. Use it when something's broken and you want help figuring out why before (or instead of) fixing it automatically.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="exercise-box">
        <h3 id="exercise-3-create-a-poetry-website">4.1.4 Exercise 3: Create a Poetry Website ✅</h3>
        <p>Use <strong>Plan</strong> mode to create an entire poetry website. Plan mode lets you review and edit Cursor's approach before it builds anything.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Press <code>Cmd+I</code> (Mac) or <code>Ctrl+I</code> (Windows) to open the AI prompt</li>
          <li>Press <code>Shift+Tab</code> to switch to <strong>Plan</strong> mode.
            <p class="step-tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Plan mode is useful when a task involves multiple files or steps—you can review the approach before Cursor writes anything. Use Agent mode for quick, single-file edits.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Ask Cursor to create a poetry website (e.g. "Create a poetry website with a nice design that puts each poem on its own page")</li>
          <li>Cursor might ask clarifying questions as part of its plan. If it does, tell it to build a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript site with no build setup</li>
          <li>Review the plan Cursor generates. You can edit it directly—add, remove, or change steps if you like</li>
          <li>When the plan looks good, click <strong>Build</strong> to have Cursor create the files</li>
          <li>Open <code>index.html</code> to view the site: go to your <code>test-project</code> folder on your computer and double-click <code>index.html</code>.
            <p class="step-tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> If the site doesn't work as expected when you open it, describe what you're seeing in the chat and ask Cursor to help debug it.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>What you learned:</strong> Plan mode lets you see and refine Cursor's approach before it writes code. For bigger tasks, reviewing the plan first helps you stay in control.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 id="what-is-the-terminal">4.2 What is the Terminal?</h2>
      <p>The terminal (also called command line or shell) is a text-based interface where you type commands to interact with your computer. Instead of clicking buttons and menus, you type instructions that your computer executes.</p>
      <p>Think of it like a conversation with your computer: you type a command, press Enter, and the computer responds with text output.</p>

      <h3 id="mac-vs-windows-terminal-differences">4.2.1 Mac vs Windows: Terminal Differences</h3>

      <h4 id="mac-terminal">Mac (Terminal)</h4>
      <p>On Mac, the terminal is called <strong>Terminal</strong>. To access it:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Press <code>Cmd + Space</code> to open Spotlight search</li>
        <li>Type "Terminal" and press Enter</li>
        <li>Or go to Applications → Utilities → Terminal</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Mac uses Unix-based commands (similar to Linux). The default shell is usually <code>zsh</code> or <code>bash</code>.</p>

      <h4 id="windows-command-prompt-or-powershell">Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell)</h4>
      <p>On Windows, you have two options:</p>
      <p><strong>Option 1: Command Prompt</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Press <code>Windows + R</code> to open Run</li>
        <li>Type <code>cmd</code> and press Enter</li>
        <li>Or search for "Command Prompt" in the Start menu</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Option 2: PowerShell (recommended)</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Press <code>Windows + X</code> and select "Windows PowerShell"</li>
        <li>Or search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu</li>
      </ol>
      <p>PowerShell is more modern and powerful, similar to Unix terminals. Many commands work similarly between PowerShell and Mac/Linux terminals.</p>

      <h3 id="using-the-terminal-in-cursor">4.2.3 Using the Terminal in Cursor</h3>

      <h4 id="how-to-open-the-terminal-in-cursor">How to Open the Terminal in Cursor</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Menu method:</strong> Go to <code>View → Terminal</code> (or <code>Terminal → New Terminal</code>)</li>
        <li><strong>Keyboard shortcut:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Mac: <code>Ctrl + `</code> (Control + backtick)</li>
            <li>Windows: <code>Ctrl + `</code> (Control + backtick)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Command Palette:</strong> Press <code>Cmd+Shift+P</code> (Mac) or <code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code> (Windows), then type "Terminal: Create New Terminal"</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="exercise-box">
        <h3 id="exercise-4-try-a-few-commands">4.2.4 Exercise 4: Try a Few Commands ✅</h3>
        <p>With your <code>test-project</code> folder open in Cursor, open the terminal (<code>Ctrl + `</code>) and try these commands. You're not memorizing—just getting a feel for how it works.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Type <code>pwd</code> and press Enter. You'll see the path to your project folder.</li>
          <li>Type <code>ls</code> (Mac) or <code>dir</code> (Windows) and press Enter. You'll see the files in your folder—including <code>poem.txt</code> and any HTML files from the earlier exercises.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>What you learned:</strong> The terminal shows you where you are and what's in the folder. That's enough to get started—you can always ask Cursor what a command does or how to do something.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="callout-box">
        <p>Use the terminal in Cursor. Doing so adds its output to Cursor's <strong>context</strong>. Context is the information Cursor can see to understand the project and generate output. It includes the chat history, files you opened, code you selected, and terminal output (when used in Cursor). If something goes wrong, Cursor can see the error and help you fix it.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you run <code>bash script.sh</code> and get an error, you can ask Cursor "What's wrong?" and it will see the error message and suggest a fix.</p>
        <p>What is <em>not</em> in Cursor's context? Files outside your project folder, web pages you have open in your browser, and anything you haven't explicitly opened, selected, or run in Cursor.</p>
        <p>You can add files to the context using the <code>@</code> symbol. Type <code>@</code> in the chat input, then type or select a filename—Cursor will include that file in the context for your next message. This can be useful when you want Cursor to focus on a specific file that isn't already open or when you're asking about code in a file you haven't selected.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="exercise-box">
        <h3 id="exercise-5-hello-world-no-installation-required">4.2.5 Exercise 5: Hello World ✅</h3>
        <p>Let's start with something simple that works on any computer without installing anything.</p>

        <h4 id="step-1-ask-cursor-to-create-a-hello-world-script">Step 1: Ask Cursor to Create a Hello World Script</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Open Cursor and create a new folder (or use an existing project folder)</li>
          <li>Open the Agent (Composer) by pressing <code>Cmd+I</code> (Mac) or <code>Ctrl+I</code> (Windows)</li>
          <li>Type this prompt:</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="code-block-wrapper">
          <pre><code>Create a simple "Hello World" script that I can run in the terminal. Use a language that doesn't require installation (like a shell script for Mac or batch file for Windows).</code></pre>
          <button type="button" class="copy-code-btn">Copy</button>
        </div>
        <ol start="4">
          <li>Cursor will create a script file for you</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="step-2-run-the-script">Step 2: Run the Script</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the terminal in Cursor (<code>Ctrl + `</code>)</li>
          <li>Run the script:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mac:</strong> Type <code>bash hello.sh</code> (or whatever filename Cursor created)</li>
              <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Type <code>hello.bat</code> (or whatever filename Cursor created)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>You should see "Hello World" printed in the terminal!</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>What you learned:</strong> You can ask Cursor to create scripts, and then run them directly in Cursor's integrated terminal.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="exercise-box">
        <h3 id="exercise-6-a-number-guessing-game-no-installation-required">4.2.6 Exercise 6: A Number-Guessing Game ✅</h3>
        <p>Now let's try a slightly more involved script—still without installing anything. We'll build a simple game you can run in the terminal using a shell script (Mac) or batch file (Windows).</p>
        <p><strong>The game:</strong> The program randomly picks an integer between 1 and 10 and asks the user to guess. If the guess is wrong, it replies in the terminal with either "Wrong guess! Too High!" or "Wrong guess! Too Low!" and prompts the user to try again. If the guess is correct, it replies with "Correct! Good job!" and then ends.</p>

        <h4 id="step-1-ask-cursor-to-create-the-game">Step 1: Ask Cursor to Create the Game</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>In Cursor, ask the Agent something like:</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="code-block-wrapper">
          <pre><code>Write a number guessing game script that I can run in the terminal without installing anything. Use a shell script for Mac (bash) and a batch file for Windows. The program randomly picks an integer between 1 and 10 and asks the user to guess. If the guess is wrong, print "Wrong guess! Too High!" or "Wrong guess! Too Low!" as appropriate and ask again; if correct, print "Correct! Good job!" and exit.</code></pre>
          <button type="button" class="copy-code-btn">Copy</button>
        </div>
        <ol start="2">
          <li>Cursor will create a script file for you (e.g. <code>guess_the_number.sh</code> on Mac or <code>guess_the_number.bat</code> on Windows)</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="step-2-run-your-game">Step 2: Run Your Game</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the terminal in Cursor (<code>Ctrl + `</code>)</li>
          <li>Run the script:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mac:</strong> Type <code>bash guess_the_number.sh</code> (or whatever filename Cursor created)</li>
              <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Type <code>guess_the_number.bat</code> (or whatever filename Cursor created)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Guess numbers until you see "Correct! Good job!"</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>What you learned:</strong> You can ask Cursor to build a small program from a description. The terminal is where you run programs and see their output, and shell scripts and batch files work without installing a programming language. Cursor can use terminal errors as context to help you fix issues.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="exercise-box">
        <h3 id="exercise-7-install-node-js-and-see-cursors-guardrails">4.2.7 Exercise 7: Install Node.js ✅</h3>
        <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser. We'll use it in this bootcamp to build web apps—it powers the tools and frameworks that turn your code into a real application.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>In Cursor, ask the Agent something like: "Install Node.js on my [Mac/Windows] system."</li>
          <li>Notice what happens: Cursor will explain what Node.js is and give you platform-specific instructions (e.g. a command to run in Homebrew on Mac, or a link to download on Windows). Cursor will <em>not</em> run the installation for you—that's a built-in guardrail. System-level installations require your direct approval.</li>
          <li>Follow Cursor's instructions. On Mac, you'll typically run a command in the terminal (e.g. <code>brew install node</code>). On Windows, you'll download the installer from nodejs.org and run it, following the setup wizard.</li>
          <li>If you're on Windows, you may need to restart Cursor (or open a new terminal) after installation so it picks up the updated PATH.</li>
          <li>Ask Cursor to verify that Node.js was installed correctly (e.g. "Can you check if Node.js is installed?"). Cursor can run <code>node -v</code> in the terminal and confirm the version.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>What you learned:</strong> Cursor has guardrails that limit what it can do automatically. For things like installing software on your system, it will guide you step-by-step but won't execute the command itself. You stay in control.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The terminal might seem intimidating at first, but it's just another way to talk to your computer. With Cursor's help, you'll get comfortable with it quickly.</p>

      <h2 id="configure-github-in-cursor">4.3 Configure GitHub in Cursor</h2>
      <p>Connect your GitHub account to Cursor so you can push and pull code without entering credentials every time. Use the same GitHub account you created in the <a href="pre-work.html#create-a-github-account">Pre-Work</a> steps.</p>
      <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open Cursor</li>
        <li>Open the Source Control view by clicking the branch icon in the left sidebar, or go to <strong>View → Source Control</strong></li>
        <li>If you're not signed in to GitHub, click <strong>Sign in with GitHub</strong> (or click the account icon in the bottom-left corner and choose <strong>Turn on Settings Sync</strong> or <strong>Sign in to GitHub</strong>)</li>
        <li>Complete the sign-in in your browser when prompted. Authorize Cursor to access your GitHub account</li>
        <li>Once signed in, Cursor will use your GitHub account for cloning repos, pushing, and pulling—no need to enter your password each time</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>You're done when:</strong> Your GitHub account appears in the Source Control view or in the account menu (bottom-left), and you're ready to clone and push repos from Cursor.</p>
